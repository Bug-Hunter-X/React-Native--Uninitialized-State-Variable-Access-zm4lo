This error occurs when you try to access a state variable in a functional component before it has been initialized.  This often happens when using `useState` within a conditional statement or when the component renders before the state is properly set. For example:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  if (someCondition) {
    // count might be undefined here!
    console.log(count); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'count')
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
